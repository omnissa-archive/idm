# Contributing to Omnissa idm

The Omnissa idm project team welcomes contributions from the community. 

## Contribution Flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

- Fork the repository
- Create a topic branch on *your fork*<sup>\*</sup> from where you want to base your work
- Make commits of logical units
- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format (see below)
- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository
- Submit a pull request

<sup>\*</sup> Make sure that you create a branch on your fork and not the main repository. 
If you push your changes together with your PR from a branch you created on the main repository, it would 
trigger the CI twice (on push and on PR), resulting in unecessary load on Github Actions.

Example:

``` shell
git remote add upstream https://github.com/omnissa-archive/idm.git
git checkout -b my-new-feature master
git commit -a
git push origin my-new-feature
```

### Staying In Sync With Upstream

When your branch gets out of sync with the omnissa-archive/master branch, use the following to update:

``` shell
git checkout my-new-feature
git fetch -a
git pull --rebase upstream master
git push --force-with-lease origin my-new-feature
```

### Formatting Commit Messages

We follow the conventions on [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

Be sure to include any related GitHub issue references in the commit message.  See
[GFM syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown) for referencing issues
and commits.

## Reporting Bugs and Creating Issues

When opening a new issue, try to roughly follow the commit message format conventions above.
